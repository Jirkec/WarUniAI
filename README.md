# WarUniAI

**WarUniAI** is a foundational tool designed to bridge user interaction and game state analysis for the browser-based games DarkOrbit and WarUniverse. This project provides a basic user/player interface and sets the groundwork for further development of computer vision-driven tools and automation.

## Overview

The current version of WarUniAI focuses on establishing communication between the player (you), the client (game window), and basic external logic such as computer vision systems. Its main goal is to offer an extendable, safe starting point for advanced features like object recognition, with a focus on ethical use and anti-cheat considerations.

- **Anti-Cheat Precautions**  
  Initial setup aims for safe interaction, allowing for further development with respect for game rules and anti-cheat systems.

- **Modular & Extendable**
